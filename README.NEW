The table search code has been modified to provide a simpler interface,
we have added some checks for false positives in the code and it now
has an interface similar to the SeerSuite Inteface - the way to run the
code would include setting up the class path to include the bin directory of
tablesearch, PDFBox library, the FontBox library, jdom , the log4j library jar files
(which can be found in the lib directory) into the path and running
